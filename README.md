Some example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate some of the interesting models that we study in OR, and why they are useful in practice.

To run the notebooks, I recommend opening them using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Feel free to email me at [sbnaerjee@cornel.edu](mailto:sbanerjee@cornell.edu) if you have any questions/comments.
