Some slides and an example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate some of the models that we study in OR, and why they are useful in practice. Based on talks given at [Curie academy sessions](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/curieacademy/) in July 2021 and 2022.

To run the notebook, I recommend opening them using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
