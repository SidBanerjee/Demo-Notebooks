Some slides and an example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate some of the models that we study in OR, and why they are useful in practice. Based on a talk given at a [Curie academy session](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/curieacademy/) in July 2021.

To run the notebook, I recommend opening them using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Feel free to email me at [sbnaerjee@cornel.edu](mailto:sbanerjee@cornell.edu) if you have any questions/comments.
